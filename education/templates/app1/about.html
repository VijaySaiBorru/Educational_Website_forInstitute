<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
<p>Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning 
    dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. 
    We tackle math, science, computing, history, art history, economics, and more, including K-14 
    and test preparation (SAT, Praxis, LSAT) content. We focus on skill mastery to help learners 
    establish strong foundations, so there's no limit to what they can learn next!</p>
    
<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>Weâ€™re working hard to ensure that Academy empowers coaches of all kinds to better 
    understand what their children or students are up to and how best to help them. 
    See at a glance whether a child or student is struggling or if she hit a streak and is now 
    far ahead of the class. Our teacher dashboard provides a summary of class performance as a 
    whole as well as detailed student profiles.</p>
